The goal was to create a functioning Rails Application that can take users through a website and give them the ability to use CRUD commands to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data while being able to veiw the changes on the website(Rails Application).

## Learning Goals

Learning goals and areas of focus consisted of:

- Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
- Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
- Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
- Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior
